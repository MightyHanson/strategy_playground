## Project: Yield Curve Construction and Analysis

### Overview
This project constructs and analyzes yield curves using historical and updated yield data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). It bootstraps zero-coupon yield curves, interpolates the curves for additional maturities, and generates visualizations to compare bootstrapped and interpolated yield curves.
