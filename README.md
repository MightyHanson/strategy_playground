## Project: Yield Curve Construction and Analysis

### Overview
This project constructs and analyzes yield curves using historical and updated yield data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). It interpolates the curves for additional maturities, and generates visualizations of the interpolated yield curves.

## Project: Interest Rate Modeling

### Overview
This project implements and compares different interest rate models, specifically the Vasicek, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR), and Hull-White models. It fetches historical Treasury yield data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, calibrates the models to the data, and simulates interest rate paths. The results are then visualized and saved to an Excel file for further analysis.
