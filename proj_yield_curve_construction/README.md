## Project: Yield Curve Construction, Bootstrapping, and Analysis

### Overview
This project involves constructing and analyzing yield curves using historical and updated yield data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). The key steps include bootstrapping the yield curve with continuous compounding to derive zero-coupon rates, interpolating the curve to obtain yields for additional maturities, and optimizing the yield curve to match market data more closely. The project generates visualizations to compare the interpolated yield curve with the optimized curve, helping to illustrate the effectiveness of the calibration process. According to the comparison pdf, the optimized boostrap curve is close to the interpolated yield curve.
